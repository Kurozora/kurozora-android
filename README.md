[Kurozora](https://kurozora.app) is your one-stop shop for everything anime!
The Kurozora Android client app gives you access to the huge catalogue of anime, manga and games. It is designed to be:

* **🏃🏻‍♂️ Responsive:** Kurozora is built with Kotlin, a **fun**, **modern**, **safe** and **interactive** programming language.

* **💻 Colossal:** The app is carefully designed to work perfectly on all screen sizes. Yes even on Samsung's Insane 292-Inch Wall TV.

* **🎨 Chameleon:** Whether black, blue, purple, or orange, it fits right with your custom theme that you spent countless hours to perfect instead of doing your work.

* **📚 Documented:** With up to 85% documentation coverage.

* **💕 Excellence:** [Kurozora API](https://github.com/kurozora/kurozora-web) and Kurozora Android are simply meant to be for each other. It’s like peanut butter and jelly, like yin and yang, like a lace in a shoe, like you're the sail of my love boat wait.. ughhh…
