The Kurozora Android client app gives you access to the huge catalogue of anime, manga and games. It is designed to be:

* **üíª Colossal:** The app is carefully designed to work perfectly on all screen sizes. Yes even on Samsung's Insane 292-Inch Wall TV.

* **üé® Chameleon:** Whether black, blue, purple, or orange, it fits right with your custom theme that you spent countless hours to perfect instead of doing your work.

* **üìö Documented:** With up to 85% documentation coverage.

* **üíï Excellence:** [Kurozora API](https://github.com/kurozora/kurozora-web) and Kurozora Android are simply meant to be for each other. It‚Äôs like peanut butter and jelly, like yin and yang, like a lace in a shoe, like you're the sail of my love boat wait.. ughhh‚Ä¶
